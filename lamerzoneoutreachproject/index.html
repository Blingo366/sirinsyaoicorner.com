      <h1>What is the lamerzone outreach project?</h1>
      <p>
        The lamerzone outreach project is more of a charity than a project, we help out the poor, and give to the rich, which is us. This project allows for the production 
        of resources in conjunction with the amazing design team over at the lamer zone. It also allows for the sharing of insane design and crypto mining teams to lamerzone, 
        where 3 crypto miners and 2 design team members will defenestrate from the Yaoi corner to lamerzone, and 4 coal miners and 6 meme influx generators will
        go from the lamerzone headquarters on jupiter to the Yaoi corner hq in Ouagadogu. Along with this, we wil set up a permenant lift between the two headquaters,
        which can bend space time and travel between space at a speed never seen before in mankind. We will also create a superspecies of human, known as the Lamercorner breed.
        These will have tentacles and 4 eyes, and no mouth. They will digest food through their skin.
