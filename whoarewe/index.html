      <h1>What is our mission here at the Yaoi Corner?</h1>
      <p>
        Here at Sirin's yaoi corner we strive for seeing the best in humans. We view humans not as a resource, 
        but as a plant that needs to be nourished. We only post the most supreme yaoi here, not any evil Yaoi. 
        We aren't just any old corner, we are the corner of a mansion, we are the touchstone of society, and we are the saviours of humanity.

      <h2>Who are we here at the yaoi corner?</h2>
      <p>
        Here at the yaoi corner, our small teem delivers an exquisite yaoi experience, personalised for every last pedestrian. Our small but attentive team of 
        chinese workers are capable of great things in a short amount of time, if you would like anything added, please speak to one of our representatives!
        You know how the saying goes, if you sit enough monkeys down at typewriters, they will, one day write shakespeare. This is our core value here at the Yaoi corner, as seen in figure A, which is actually a 
        picture of one of our chief writers here at the corner. All of our coding is handled in a small factory in China, who pays their workers very well, we can assure you.
